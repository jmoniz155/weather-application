# weather-application

## Description

This is where I use my knowledge in HTML, CSS javascript/jQuery to build this Weather Application. This Weather dashboard will display a 5 day forcast for the city of your choice and save it for your convience.

## Function

This weather dashboard will display a 5 day forcast for the city of your choice and save it for your convience without having to retype it over again. You will be directed to the main dashboard where you need to enter in a city and click the search icon.  It will then save your choice and the 5 day forecast will display the temperature, humidity and wind speed. It will even display icons for cloudy, rain and sunny days.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for taking the time to help me understand how to use javascript and bootstrap building a Weather Dashboard.  I have learned so much on this assignment. Thank you for really taking the time to explain how to read and understand the acceptance criteria to generate code and using google.
